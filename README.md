## Permissions Management

The `/permissions` command allows the owner role to manage admin/mod roles, command permissions, and ignored commands directly from Discord. All changes are stored in the MySQL database.

### Usage

#### Add/Remove Admin or Mod Roles
- `/permissions action:add_admin_role role:@Admin`
- `/permissions action:remove_admin_role role:@Admin`
- `/permissions action:add_mod_role role:@Mod`
- `/permissions action:remove_mod_role role:@Mod`

#### Set Command Permissions
- `/permissions action:set_command_permission command:giveitem roles:admin`  
  (Only admin roles can use `giveitem`)
- `/permissions action:set_command_permission command:giveitem roles:mod`  
  (Only mod roles can use `giveitem`)
- `/permissions action:set_command_permission command:giveitem roles:both`  
  (Both admin and mod roles can use `giveitem`)
- `/permissions action:set_command_permission command:giveitem roles:none`  
  (No staff roles can use `giveitem`)

#### Manage Ignored Commands
- `/permissions action:add_ignored_command command:ping`  
  (Everyone can use the `ping` command, regardless of role)
- `/permissions action:remove_ignored_command command:ping`  
  (Removes `ping` from the ignored list)

#### List All Permissions
- `/permissions action:list`

This will display:
- All admin and mod roles
- All ignored commands
- All command permissions and which roles can use them

**Note:** Only users with the owner role (set by `salt_discord_owner_role_id` in your config) can use the `/permissions` command.

---

## Development

- **Commands** are located in `src/commands/`
- **Server logic** in `src/server.js` and `src/server.lua`
- **Client logic** in `src/client.lua`
- **Exports**: Lua and JS communicate via FiveM's `global.exports` and registered functions.

### Adding/Editing Commands

- Add new command files to `src/commands/`
- Each command exports a module with `name`, `description`, `options`, and `execute` function.

### Lua â†” JS Communication

- Lua functions are registered and called from JS using `global.exports[GetCurrentResourceName()]`
- See `src/server.lua` for registered functions like `fetchJobs`, `fetchCharacter`, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your bot token and client ID are correct in `server.cfg`
- Make sure the bot is invited to your Discord server with the correct permissions (slash commands, embeds)
- Check server console for errors if commands do not respond
